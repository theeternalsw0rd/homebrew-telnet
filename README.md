# homebrew-telnet
Tap for telnet

In MacOS 10.13, the one included with homebrew will work, but will not build in 10.14 due to i386 being deprecated. At some point I'll change the name of this package to make it easier.

To install:

```
brew tap theeternalsw0rd/telnet
brew install theeternalsw0rd/telnet/telnet
```
